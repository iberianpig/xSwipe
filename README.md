xSwipe
======================
xSwipe is multitouch gesture recognizer.
This script make your linux PC able to recognize swipes.

**Ubuntu15.04, or later**  
I released [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma), it use libinput driver and suppport pinch zoom .  
You should try [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) instead of xSwipe if you use Ubuntu15.04, or later. 
It need not depend on older version synaptics driver, and it works well with libinput driver supported by 15.04 or later as standard.

## Usage

Before running the script, you must first do some preparations.

  1. Download xSwipe
  2. Install X11::GUITest
  3. Enable SHMConfig

### 1. Download xSwipe
Type below code, download xSwipe from github

    $ cd ~
    $ wget https://github.com/iberianpig/xSwipe/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip

### 2. Install X11::GUITest

To install libx11-guitest-perl from synaptic package manager
Or run the script on the terminal run as

    $ sudo apt-get install libx11-guitest-perl

---
#### NOTE: If using Ubuntu14.04, or later
##### Install older version synaptics driver that is compatible with xSwipe.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential libevdev-dev autoconf automake libmtdev-dev xorg-dev xutils-dev libtool
$ sudo apt-get remove -y xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
$ git clone https://github.com/Chosko/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics.git
$ cd xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --exec_prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
---

### 3. Enable SHMConfig

Open /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf with your favorite text editor and edit it to enable SHMConfig

    $ sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

**NOTE**:You will need to create the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory and create 50-synaptics.conf if it doesn't exist yet.
     `$ sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`

##### /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

    Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "evdev touchpad catchall"
    Driver "synaptics"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    Option "Protocol" "event"
    Option "SHMConfig" "on"
    EndSection

To reflect SHMConfig, restart your session.

That's it for preparation.

## Run xSwipe

To run xSwipe, type below code on terminal.

    $ perl ~/xSwipe-master/xSwipe.pl

**Note:You should run xSwipe.pl in same directory as "eventKey.cfg" .**

You can use "swipe" with 3 or 4 fingers, they can call an event.
Additionally, some gestures are available.

* *edge-swipe* : swipe with 2 fingers from outside edge(need to enable with option).
* *long-press* : hold pressure for 0.5 seconds with 3 or 4 fingers.

### Option

*   `-d RATE` :
      *RATE* is sensitivity to swipe.Default value is 1.
      Shorten swipe-length by half (e.g.,`$ perl xSwipe.pl -d 0.5`)
*   `-m INTERVAL` :
      *INTERVAL* is how often synclient monitor changes to the touchpad state.
      Default value is 10(ms).
      Set 50ms as monitoring-span. (e.g.,`$ perl xSwipe.pl -m 50`)
*   `-n` :
      Natural scroll like Macbook, use "/nScroll/eventKey.cfg".
*   `-e` :
      Enable edge-swipe

## Customize
You can customize the settings for gestues to edit eventKey.cfg.
